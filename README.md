</div>

### Currently WIP
**A Swift macOS app built in SwiftUI that lets you paste, load, or drag-and-drop JSON to validate it using our hand-crafted JSON parser — no `JSONSerialization`, fully custom lexer + parser.**

***This project implements a complete, standards-compliant JSON parser in pure Swift, following the official RFC 8259 specification.
Built as a learning exercise in lexical analysis and recursive descent parsing, it supports all JSON data types and nested structures — including proper error reporting with line/column numbers.***
