# JSONParser

**A Swift JSON parser built from scratch. No frameworks, no `JSONSerialization`.** 

***This project implements a complete, standards-compliant JSON parser in pure Swift, following the official RFC 8259 specification.
Built as a learning exercise in lexical analysis and recursive descent parsing, it supports all JSON data types and nested structures — including proper error reporting with line/column numbers.***
